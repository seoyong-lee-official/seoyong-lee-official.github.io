I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, where I study Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
I enjoy discovering and reflecting on elegant and novel ideas.

Currently, Iâ€™m an undergraduate researcher at [Accelerated Intelligent Systems Lab (AISys), SNU](https://ais.snu.ac.kr/) where I focus on graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and graph pattern mining (GPM) problems.
Previously, I worked as a data scientist at [AB180(AIRBRIDGE)](https://www.ab180.co/en) and as a research scientist at [AIRS Medical](https://airsmed.com/)
