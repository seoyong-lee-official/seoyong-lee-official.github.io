Hello! I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I am currently studying about parallel algorithms for graph pattern mining at [Accelerated Intelligent Systems Lab (AISys), SNU](https://ais.snu.ac.kr/), as an undergraduate research intern.
Before that I worked as a data scientist at [AB180(AIRBRIDGE)](https://www.ab180.co/en) and as a research scientist at [AIRS Medical](https://airsmed.com/)

please feel free to contact me at: **sylee2685 {at} gmail {dot} com**
