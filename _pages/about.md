Hello! I am an undergraduate student at Seoul National University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I am currently working as a data scientist on [AB180](https://www.ab180.co/en), focusing on developing RAG framework.
Before that I worked as a research scientist on [AIRS Medical](https://airsmed.com/), solving problems related to MR Imaging and deep learning.

please feel free to contact me at: **sylee2685 {at} gmail {dot} com**
