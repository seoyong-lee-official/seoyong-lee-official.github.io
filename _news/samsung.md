The **Interval Scheduling Problem** has a well-known, simple \( O(n) \) greedy solution.  
But what if the problem becomes more complex? Imagine solving \( k \) Interval Scheduling Problems, each with \( n/k \) unique independent intervals and \( n \) shared intervals across all \( k \) problems.  
Can you design an algorithm that beats the naïve \( O(kn) \) approach?

I was fortunate to discover an \( O(n \log n) \) algorithm, inspired from **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** problems, to tackle this challenge—and it earned me an award.
