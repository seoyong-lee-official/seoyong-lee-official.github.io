The **Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD)** constitutes a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization.  
When extended to incorporate **heterogeneous fleets**, **time-window restrictions**, and **vehicle capacity constraints**, the problemâ€™s complexity grows combinatorially, rendering exact methods computationally prohibitive at scale.  

In such a setting, the central question becomes: **how would you design an algorithm capable of producing high-quality solutions under these constraints?**
This was precisely the challenge posed by the *2024 Optimization Grand Challenge*, hosted by LG CNS in collaboration with the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers.  

Our approach combined **Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)** with **Set Partitioning Problem formulation**. 
The hybridization of heuristic flexibility with exact optimization yielded a decisive outcome:  *1st place out of 378 teams*.

This achievement was particularly meaningful as it was a joint effort with my longtime collaborator and friend, [Wonjae](https://github.com/prisem123).
