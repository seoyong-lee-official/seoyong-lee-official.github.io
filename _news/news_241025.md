We tackled the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries**, involving a **heterogeneous fleet**, **time windows**, and **capacitated vehicles**. 
This combinatorial optimization problem challenged us to achieve the best scoring algorithm in a competitive setting. 
Our approach utilized **Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)** combined with a **Set Partitioning Problem** formulation, securing **1st place**.
The competition was hosted by LG CNS in collaboration with the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers.

This work was a joint effort with my longtime friend, [Wonjae](https://github.com/prisem123), making it a uniquely meaningful experience to collaborate with someone from my middle school days in an academic competition.
